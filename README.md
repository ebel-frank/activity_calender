# Activity Calender
Activity Calender is a productivity app. I built it to help users manage their events/activities, timetable and also take notes. 
So you actually don't miss out on anything from school parties, classes, church fellowships, bootcamps, seminars and lots more.
I also added reminders: 5min before, 30min before and so on; so that you get notified for any event youv'e set. With this feature, 
the app makes sure your'e at the the right place at the right time with the right group doing the right thing.

And as a token from my heart‚ù§Ô∏è, I added several quotes to the app. We all need motivation once in a while, isn't that right?üòá

I am making the project free cause I want the upcoming android developers to learn from this project. I still remember I spent my corona period building this.
It has cost me alot building this and I hope you appreciate it. On no occassion should you plagiarize any content in this project. 
If you do, I will find you and I will place a bug in your code that will cause you a strong headacheüòí.
Thank you for your obedience.

This app is not on play store or any other store.
